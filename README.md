### Calculation of WPM/SPM

The WPM are calculated by taking the amount of correctly written symbols per minute and dividing them by 5 (the average length of an english word).

### Stack

Coffeetyper is written in [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) with Typescript and uses Windicss in conjuction with Postcss. 

### Should you use Coffeetyper?

It still lacks some features and isn't so feature rich as Monkeytype. But it provides the most important functions and statistics of a typing test and is definitely useable.

### Color Schemes

Credit for the color schemes goes to [Monkeytype](https://github.com/Miodec/monkeytype).
